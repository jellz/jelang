# jelang

jelang is a programming language I'm currently working on

- Currently has a lexer, parser, and passes (limited type-checking, code-generation)
- Compiles to TypeScript (may change in the future)
- Planning to redo file structure/naming convention, and organise some variables better
- Highly experimental; things will change often; plenty of bugs
- File extension is `.jll`, may change in the future
